<p>Transcribed from the 1864 Chapman and Hall &ldquo;Tales of All
Countries&rdquo; edition by David Price, email

<h1>THE MISTLETOE BOUGH.</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Let the boys have it if they like it,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Garrow, pleading to her only daughter on behalf of her two
sons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t, mamma,&rdquo; said Elizabeth
Garrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;It only means romping.&nbsp; To me all that
is detestable, and I am sure it is not the sort of thing that
Miss Holmes would like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always had it at Christmas when we were
young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mamma, the world is so changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The point in dispute was one very delicate in its nature,
hardly to be discussed in all its bearings, even in fiction, and
the very mention of which between mother and daughter showed a
great amount of close confidence between them.&nbsp; It was no
less than this.&nbsp; Should that branch of mistletoe which Frank
Garrow had brought home with him out of the Lowther woods be hung
up on Christmas Eve in the dining-room at Thwaite Hall, according
to his wishes; or should permission for such hanging be
positively refused?&nbsp; It was clearly a thing not to be done
after such a discussion, and therefore the decision given by Mrs.
Garrow was against it.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think that Miss Garrow was right in saying
that the world is changed as touching mistletoe boughs.&nbsp;
Kissing, I fear, is less innocent now than it used to be when our
grand-mothers were alive, and we have become more fastidious in
our amusements.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I think that she made herself
fairly open to the raillery with which her brothers attacked
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honi soit qui mal y pense,&rdquo; said Frank, who was
eighteen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody will want to kiss you, my lady Fineairs,&rdquo;
said Harry, who was just a year younger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you choose to be a Puritan, there are to be no
more cakes and ale in the house,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still waters run deep; we all know that,&rdquo; said
Harry.</p>
<p>The boys had not been present when the matter was decided
between Mrs. Garrow and her daughter, nor had the mother been
present when these little amenities had passed between the
brothers and sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that mamma has said it, and I wouldn&rsquo;t seem
to go against her,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d ask my
father.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t give way to such nonsense, I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth turned away without answering, and left the
room.&nbsp; Her eyes were full of tears, but she would not let
them see that they had vexed her.&nbsp; They were only two days
home from school, and for the last week before their coming, all
her thoughts had been to prepare for their Christmas
pleasures.&nbsp; She had arranged their rooms, making everything
warm and pretty.&nbsp; Out of her own pocket she had bought a
shot-belt for one, and skates for the other.&nbsp; She had told
the old groom that her pony was to belong exclusively to Master
Harry for the holidays, and now Harry told her that still waters
ran deep.&nbsp; She had been driven to the use of all her
eloquence in inducing her father to purchase that gun for Frank,
and now Frank called her a Puritan.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; She did
not choose that a mistletoe bough should be hung in her
father&rsquo;s hall, when Godfrey Holmes was coming to visit
him.&nbsp; She could not explain this to Frank, but Frank might
have had the wit to understand it.&nbsp; But Frank was thinking
only of Patty Coverdale, a blue-eyed little romp of sixteen, who,
with her sister Kate, was coming from Penrith to spend the
Christmas at Thwaite Hall.&nbsp; Elizabeth left the room with her
slow, graceful step, hiding her tears,&mdash;hiding all emotion,
as latterly she had taught herself that it was feminine to
do.&nbsp; &ldquo;There goes my lady Fineairs,&rdquo; said Harry,
sending his shrill voice after her.</p>
<p>Thwaite Hall was not a place of much pretension.&nbsp; It was
a moderate-sized house, surrounded by pretty gardens and
shrubberies, close down upon the river Eamont, on the
Westmoreland side of the river, looking over to a lovely wooded
bank in Cumberland.&nbsp; All the world knows that the Eamont
runs out of Ulleswater, dividing the two counties, passing under
Penrith Bridge and by the old ruins of Brougham Castle, below
which it joins the Eden.&nbsp; Thwaite Hall nestled down close
upon the clear rocky stream about half way between Ulleswater and
Penrith, and had been built just at a bend of the river.&nbsp;
The windows of the dining-parlour and of the drawing-room stood
at right angles to each other, and yet each commanded a reach of
the stream.&nbsp; Immediately from a side of the house steps were
cut down through the red rock to the water&rsquo;s edge, and here
a small boat was always moored to a chain.&nbsp; The chain was
stretched across the river, fixed to the staples driven into the
rock on either side, and the boat was pulled backwards and
forwards over the stream without aid from oars or paddles.&nbsp;
From the opposite side a path led through the woods and across
the fields to Penrith, and this was the route commonly used
between Thwaite Hall and the town.</p>
<p>Major Garrow was a retired officer of Engineers, who had seen
service in all parts of the world, and who was now spending the
evening of his days on a small property which had come to him
from his father.&nbsp; He held in his own hands about twenty
acres of land, and he was the owner of one small farm close by,
which was let to a tenant.&nbsp; That, together with his
half-pay, and the interest of his wife&rsquo;s thousand pounds,
sufficed to educate his children and keep the wolf at a
comfortable distance from his door.&nbsp; He himself was a spare
thin man, with quiet, lazy, literary habits.&nbsp; He had done
the work of life, but had so done it as to permit of his enjoying
that which was left to him.&nbsp; His sole remaining care was the
establishment of his children; and, as far as he could see, he
had no ground for anticipating disappointment.&nbsp; They were
clever, good-looking, well-disposed young people, and upon the
whole it may be said that the sun shone brightly on Thwaite
Hall.&nbsp; Of Mrs. Garrow it may suffice to say that she always
deserved such sunshine.</p>
<p>For years past it had been the practice of the family to have
some sort of gathering at Thwaite Hall during Christmas.&nbsp;
Godfrey Holmes had been left under the guardianship of Major
Garrow, and, as he had always spent his Christmas holidays with
his guardian, this, perhaps, had given rise to the
practice.&nbsp; Then the Coverdales were cousins of the Garrows,
and they had usually been there as children.&nbsp; At the
Christmas last past the custom had been broken, for young Holmes
had been abroad.&nbsp; Previous to that, they had all been
children, excepting him.&nbsp; But now that they were to meet
again, they were no longer children.&nbsp; Elizabeth, at any
rate, was not so, for she had already counted nineteen
winters.&nbsp; And Isabella Holmes was coming.&nbsp; Now Isabella
was two years older than Elizabeth, and had been educated in
Brussels; moreover she was comparatively a stranger at Thwaite
Hall, never having been at those early Christmas meetings.</p>
<p>And now I must take permission to begin my story by telling a
lady&rsquo;s secret.&nbsp; Elizabeth Garrow had already been in
love with Godfrey Holmes, or perhaps it might be more becoming to
say that Godfrey Holmes had already been in love with her.&nbsp;
They had already been engaged; and, alas! they had already agreed
that that engagement should be broken off!</p>
<p>Young Holmes was now twenty-seven years of age, and was
employed in a bank at Liverpool, not as a clerk, but as
assistant-manager, with a large salary.&nbsp; He was a man well
to do in the world, who had money also of his own, and who might
well afford to marry.&nbsp; Some two years since, on the eve of
leaving Thwaite Hall, he had with low doubting whisper told
Elizabeth that he loved her, and she had flown trembling to her
mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Godfrey, my boy,&rdquo; the father said to
him, as he parted with him the next morning, &ldquo;Bessy is only
a child, and too young to think of this yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the
next Christmas Godfrey was in Italy, and the thing was gone
by,&mdash;so at least the father and mother said to each
other.&nbsp; But the young people had met in the summer, and one
joyful letter had come from the girl home to her mother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have accepted him.&nbsp; Dearest, dearest mamma, I do
love him.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t tell papa yet, for I have not
quite accepted him.&nbsp; I think I am sure, but I am not quite
sure.&nbsp; I am not quite sure about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, two days after that, there had come a letter that
was not at all joyful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dearest Mamma,&mdash;It is
not to be.&nbsp; It is not written in the book.&nbsp; We have
both agreed that it will not do.&nbsp; I am so glad that you have
not told dear papa, for I could never make him understand.&nbsp;
You will understand, for I shall tell you everything, down to his
very words.&nbsp; But we have agreed that there shall be no
quarrel.&nbsp; It shall be exactly as it was, and he will come at
Christmas all the same.&nbsp; It would never do that he and papa
should be separated, nor could we now put off Isabella.&nbsp; It
is better so in every way, for there is and need be no
quarrel.&nbsp; We still like each other.&nbsp; I am sure I like
him, but I know that I should not make him happy as his
wife.&nbsp; He says it is my fault.&nbsp; I, at any rate, have
never told him that I thought it his.&rdquo;&nbsp; From all which
it will be seen that the confidence between the mother and
daughter was very close.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Garrow was a very good girl, but it might almost be
a question whether she was not too good.&nbsp; She had learned,
or thought that she had learned, that most girls are vapid,
silly, and useless,&mdash;given chiefly to pleasure-seeking and a
hankering after lovers; and she had resolved that she would not
be such a one.</p>
<p>Industry, self-denial, and a religious purpose in life, were
the tasks which she set herself; and she went about the
performance of them with much courage.&nbsp; But such tasks,
though they are excellently well adapted to fit a young lady for
the work of living, may also be carried too far, and thus have
the effect of unfitting her for that work.&nbsp; When Elizabeth
Garrow made up her mind that the finding of a husband was not the
only purpose of life, she did very well.&nbsp; It is very well
that a young lady should feel herself capable of going through
the world happily without one.&nbsp; But in teaching herself this
she also taught herself to think that there was a certain merit
in refusing herself the natural delight of a lover, even though
the possession of the lover were compatible with all her duties
to herself, her father and mother, and the world at large.&nbsp;
It was not that she had determined to have no lover.&nbsp; She
made no such resolve, and when the proper lover came he was
admitted to her heart.&nbsp; But she declared to herself
unconsciously that she must put a guard upon herself, lest she
should be betrayed into weakness by her own happiness.&nbsp; She
had resolved that in loving her lord she would not worship him,
and that in giving her heart she would only so give it as it
should be given to a human creature like herself.&nbsp; She had
acted on these high resolves, and hence it had come to
pass,&mdash;not unnaturally,&mdash;that Mr. Godfrey Holmes had
told her that it was &ldquo;her fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was a pretty, fair girl, with soft dark-brown hair, and
soft long dark eyelashes.&nbsp; Her grey eyes, though quiet in
their tone, were tender and lustrous.&nbsp; Her face was oval,
and the lines of her cheek and chin perfect in their
symmetry.&nbsp; She was generally quiet in her demeanour, but
when moved she could rouse herself to great energy, and speak
with feeling and almost with fire.&nbsp; Her fault was a
reverence for martyrdom in general, and a feeling, of which she
was unconscious, that it became a young woman to be unhappy in
secret;&mdash;that it became a young woman, I might rather say,
to have a source of unhappiness hidden from the world in general,
and endured without any detriment to her outward
cheerfulness.&nbsp; We know the story of the Spartan boy who held
the fox under his tunic.&nbsp; The fox was biting into
him,&mdash;into the very entrails; but the young hero spake never
a word.&nbsp; Now Bessy Garrow was inclined to think that it was
a good thing to have a fox always biting, so that the torment
caused no ruffling to her outward smiles.&nbsp; Now at this
moment the fox within her bosom was biting her sore enough, but
she bore it without flinching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would rather that he should not come I will have
it arranged,&rdquo; her mother had said to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for worlds,&rdquo; she had answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
should never think well of myself again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother had changed her own mind more than once as to the
conduct in this matter which might be best for her to follow,
thinking solely of her daughter&rsquo;s welfare.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
he comes they will be reconciled, and she will be happy,&rdquo;
had been her first idea.&nbsp; But then there was a stern
fixedness of purpose in Bessy&rsquo;s words when she spoke of Mr.
Holmes, which had expelled this hope, and Mrs. Garrow had for a
while thought it better that the young man should not come.&nbsp;
But Bessy would not permit this.&nbsp; It would vex her father,
put out of course the arrangements of other people, and display
weakness on her own part.&nbsp; He should come, and she would
endure without flinching while the fox gnawed at her.</p>
<p>That battle of the mistletoe had been fought on the morning
before Christmas-day, and the Holmeses came on
Christmas-eve.&nbsp; Isabella was comparatively a stranger, and
therefore received at first the greater share of attention.&nbsp;
She and Elizabeth had once seen each other, and for the last year
or two had corresponded, but personally they had never been
intimate.&nbsp; Unfortunately for the latter, that story of
Godfrey&rsquo;s offer and acceptance had been communicated to
Isabella, as had of course the immediately subsequent story of
their separation.&nbsp; But now it would be almost impossible to
avoid the subject in conversation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dearest Isabella,
let it be as though it had never been,&rdquo; she had said in one
of her letters.&nbsp; But sometimes it is very difficult to let
things be as though they had never been.</p>
<p>The first evening passed over very well.&nbsp; The two
Coverdale girls were there, and there had been much talking and
merry laughter, rather juvenile in its nature, but on the whole
none the worse for that.&nbsp; Isabella Holmes was a fine, tall,
handsome girl; good-humoured, and well disposed to be pleased;
rather Frenchified in her manners, and quite able to take care of
herself.&nbsp; But she was not above round games, and did not
turn up her nose at the boys.&nbsp; Godfrey behaved himself
excellently, talking much to the Major, but by no means avoiding
Miss Garrow.&nbsp; Mrs. Garrow, though she had known him since he
was a boy, had taken an aversion to him since he had quarrelled
with her daughter; but there was no room on this first night for
showing such aversion, and everything went off well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Godfrey is very much improved,&rdquo; the Major said to
his wife that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do.&nbsp; He has filled out and become a fine
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In personal appearance, you mean.&nbsp; Yes, he is
well-looking enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in his manner, too.&nbsp; He is doing uncommonly
well in Liverpool, I can tell you; and if he should think of
Bessy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing of that sort,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Garrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did speak to me, you know,&mdash;two years
ago.&nbsp; Bessy was too young then, and so indeed was he.&nbsp;
But if she likes him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s an end of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so
they went to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; said the sister to her elder brother,
knocking at his door when they had all gone up stairs, &ldquo;may
I come in,&mdash;if you are not in bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In bed,&rdquo; said he, looking up with some little
pride from his Greek book; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve one hundred and
fifty lines to do before I can get to bed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be
two, I suppose.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to mug uncommon hard these
holidays.&nbsp; I have only one more half, you know, and
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overdo it, Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I won&rsquo;t overdo it.&nbsp; I mean to take one
day a week, and work eight hours a day on the other five.&nbsp;
That will be forty hours a week, and will give me just two
hundred hours for the holidays.&nbsp; I have got it all down here
on a table.&nbsp; That will be a hundred and five for Greek play,
forty for Algebra&mdash;&rdquo; and so he explained to her the
exact destiny of all his long hours of proposed labour.&nbsp; He
had as yet been home a day and a half, and had succeeded in
drawing out with red lines and blue figures the table which he
showed her.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I can do that, it will be pretty
well; won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Frank, you have come home for your
holidays,&mdash;to enjoy yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a fellow must work now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overdo it, dear; that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp;
But, Frank, I could not rest if I went to bed without speaking to
you.&nbsp; You made me unhappy to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I, Bessy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You called me a Puritan, and then you quoted that
ill-natured French proverb at me.&nbsp; Do you really believe
your sister thinks evil, Frank?&rdquo; and as she spoke she put
her arm caressingly round his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why say so?&nbsp; Harry is so much younger and so
thoughtless that I can bear what he says without so much
suffering.&nbsp; But if you and I are not friends I shall be very
wretched.&nbsp; If you knew how I have looked forward to your
coming home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to vex you, and I won&rsquo;t say such
things again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my own Frank.&nbsp; What I said to mamma,
I said because I thought it right; but you must not say that I am
a Puritan.&nbsp; I would do anything in my power to make your
holidays bright and pleasant.&nbsp; I know that boys require so
much more to amuse them than girls do.&nbsp; Good night, dearest;
pray don&rsquo;t overdo yourself with work, and do take care of
your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying she kissed him and went her way.&nbsp; In twenty
minutes after that, he had gone to sleep over his book; and when
he woke up to find the candle guttering down, he resolved that he
would not begin his measured hours till Christmas-day was fairly
over.</p>
<p>The morning of Christmas-day passed very quietly.&nbsp; They
all went to church, and then sat round the fire chatting until
the four o&rsquo;clock dinner was ready.&nbsp; The Coverdale
girls thought it was rather more dull than former Thwaite Hall
festivities, and Frank was seen to yawn.&nbsp; But then everybody
knows that the real fun of Christmas never begins till the day
itself be passed.&nbsp; The beef and pudding are ponderous, and
unless there be absolute children in the party, there is a
difficulty in grafting any special afternoon amusements on the
Sunday pursuits of the morning.&nbsp; In the evening they were to
have a dance; that had been distinctly promised to Patty
Coverdale; but the dance would not commence till eight.&nbsp; The
beef and pudding were ponderous, but with due efforts they were
overcome and disappeared.&nbsp; The glass of port was sipped, the
almonds and raisins were nibbled, and then the ladies left the
room.&nbsp; Ten minutes after that Elizabeth found herself seated
with Isabella Holmes over the fire in her father&rsquo;s little
book-room.&nbsp; It was not by her that this meeting was
arranged, for she dreaded such a constrained confidence; but of
course it could not be avoided, and perhaps it might be as well
now as hereafter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bessy,&rdquo; said the elder girl, &ldquo;I am dying to
be alone with you for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you shall not die; that is, if being alone with
me will save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have so much to say to you.&nbsp; And if you have any
true friendship in you, you also will have so much to say to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Garrow perhaps had no true friendship in her at that
moment, for she would gladly have avoided saying anything, had
that been possible.&nbsp; But in order to prove that she was not
deficient in friendship, she gave her friend her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now tell me everything about Godfrey,&rdquo; said
Isabella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Bella, I have nothing to tell;&mdash;literally
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is nonsense.&nbsp; Stop a moment, dear, and
understand that I do not mean to offend you.&nbsp; It cannot be
that you have nothing to tell, if you choose to tell it.&nbsp;
You are not the girl to have accepted Godfrey without loving him,
nor is he the man to have asked you without loving you.&nbsp;
When you write me word that you have changed your mind, as you
might about a dress, of course I know you have not told me
all.&nbsp; Now I insist upon knowing it,&mdash;that is, if we are
to be friends.&nbsp; I would not speak a word to Godfrey till I
had seen you, in order that I might hear your story
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Bella, there is no story to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to play the part of a true friend to me,
you will let the matter pass by and say nothing.&nbsp; You must
understand that, circumstanced as we are, your brother&rsquo;s
visit here,&mdash;what I mean is, that it is very difficult for
me to act and speak exactly as I should do, and a few unfortunate
words spoken may make my position unendurable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you answer me one question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell.&nbsp; I think I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you love him?&rdquo;&nbsp; For a moment or two Bessy
remained silent, striving to arrange her words so that they
should contain no falsehood, and yet betray no truth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, I see you do,&rdquo; continued Miss Holmes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But of course you do.&nbsp; Why else did you accept
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancied that I did, as young ladies do sometimes
fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you say that you do not, now?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Again Bessy was silent, and then her friend rose from her
seat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see it all,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a pity it was that you both had not some friend like
me by you at the time!&nbsp; But perhaps it may not be too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I need not repeat at length all the protestations which upon
this were poured forth with hot energy by poor Bessy.&nbsp; She
endeavoured to explain how great had been the difficulty of her
position.&nbsp; This Christmas visit had been arranged before
that unhappy affair at Liverpool had occurred.&nbsp;
Isabella&rsquo;s visit had been partly one of business, it being
necessary that certain money affairs should be arranged between
her, her brother, and the Major.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
determined,&rdquo; said Bessy, &ldquo;not to let my feelings
stand in the way; and hoped that things might settle down to
their former friendly footing.&nbsp; I already fear that I have
been wrong, but it will be ungenerous in you to punish
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she went on to say that if anybody
attempted to interfere with her, she should at once go away to
her mother&rsquo;s sister, who lived at Hexham, in
Northumberland.</p>
<p>Then came the dance, and the hearts of Kate and Patty
Coverdale were at last happy.&nbsp; But here again poor Bessy was
made to understand how terribly difficult was this experiment of
entertaining on a footing of friendship a lover with whom she had
quarrelled only a month or two before.&nbsp; That she must as a
necessity become the partner of Godfrey Holmes she had already
calculated, and so much she was prepared to endure.&nbsp; Her
brothers would of course dance with the Coverdale girls, and her
father would of course stand up with Isabella.&nbsp; There was no
other possible arrangement, at any rate as a beginning.</p>
<p>She had schooled herself, too, as to the way in which she
would speak to him on the occasion, and how she would remain
mistress of herself and of her thoughts.&nbsp; But when the time
came the difficulty was almost too much for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not care much for dancing, if I remember?&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I do.&nbsp; Not as Patty Coverdale does.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a passion with her.&nbsp; But then I am older than
Patty Coverdale.&rdquo;&nbsp; After that he was silent for a
minute or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so odd to me to be here again,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; It was odd;&mdash;she felt that it was odd.&nbsp; But
he ought not to have said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two years make a great difference.&nbsp; The boys have
grown so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there are other things,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bella was never here before; at least not with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; But I did not exactly mean that.&nbsp; All
that would not make the place so strange.&nbsp; But your mother
seems altered to me.&nbsp; She used to be almost like my own
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she finds that you are a more formidable
person as you grow older.&nbsp; It was all very well scolding you
when you were a clerk in the bank, but it does not do to scold
the manager.&nbsp; These are the penalties men pay for becoming
great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not my greatness that stands in my way,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m sure I cannot say what it is.&nbsp; But
Patty will scold you if you do not mind the figure, though you
were the whole Board of Directors packed into one.&nbsp; She
won&rsquo;t respect you if you neglect your present
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bessy went to bed that night she began to feel that she
had attempted too much.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;could I not make some excuse and go away to Aunt
Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mamma; now; to-morrow.&nbsp; I need not say that
it will make me very unhappy to be away at such a time, but I
begin to think that it will be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will papa say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell him all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Aunt Mary must be told also.&nbsp; You would not
like that.&nbsp; Has he said anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing;&mdash;very little, that is.&nbsp; But
Bella has spoken to me.&nbsp; Oh, mamma, I think we have been
very wrong in this.&nbsp; That is, I have been wrong.&nbsp; I
feel as though I should disgrace myself, and turn the whole party
here into a misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be dreadful, that telling of the story to her father
and to her aunt, and such a necessity must, if possible, be
avoided.&nbsp; Should such a necessity actually come, the former
task would, no doubt, be done by her mother, but that would not
lighten the load materially.&nbsp; After a fortnight she would
again meet her father, and would be forced to discuss it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will remain if it be possible,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;but, mamma, if I wish to go, you will not stop
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her mother promised that she would not stop her,
but strongly advised her to stand her ground.</p>
<p>On the following morning, when she came down stairs before
breakfast, she found Frank standing in the hall with his gun, of
which he was trying the lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not loaded, is
it, Frank?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no; no one thinks of loading now-a-days till
he has got out of the house.&nbsp; Directly after breakfast I am
going across with Godfrey to the back of Greystock, to see after
some moor-fowl.&nbsp; He asked me to go, and I couldn&rsquo;t
well refuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&nbsp; Why should you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be deuced hard work to make up the time.&nbsp;
I was to have been up at four this morning, but that alarum went
off and never woke me.&nbsp; However, I shall be able to do
something to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a slavery of your holidays,
Frank.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the good of having a new gun if
you&rsquo;re not to use it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the new gun.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not such a
child as that comes to.&nbsp; But, you see, Godfrey is here, and
one ought to be civil to him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you what I
want you girls to do, Bessy.&nbsp; You must come and meet us on
our way home.&nbsp; Come over in the boat and along the path to
the Patterdale road.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be there under the hill
about five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you are not, we are to wait in the
snow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make difficulties, Bessy.&nbsp; I tell you
we will be there.&nbsp; We are to go in the cart, and so shall
have plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you know the other girls will go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth, Patty Coverdale has
promised.&nbsp; As for Miss Holmes, if she won&rsquo;t, why you
must leave her at home with mamma.&nbsp; But Kate and Patty
can&rsquo;t come without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your discretion has found that out, has it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say so.&nbsp; But you will come; won&rsquo;t you,
Bessy?&nbsp; As for waiting, it&rsquo;s all nonsense.&nbsp; Of
course you can walk on.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ll be at the stile by
five.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got my watch, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then Bessy promised him.&nbsp; What would she not have done for
him that was in her power to do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&nbsp; Of course I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Miss
Holmes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m up to anything.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
have gone with them this morning, and have taken a gun if
they&rsquo;d asked me.&nbsp; But, by-the-bye, I&rsquo;d better
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Patty, who was hardly yet without
fear lest something should mar the expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will three gentlemen do with four
ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot,&rdquo; said Patty innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Kate;
&ldquo;you may have Harry if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for nothing,&rdquo; said Miss Holmes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want one for myself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all very well for
you to make the offer, but what should I do if Harry
wouldn&rsquo;t have me?&nbsp; There are two sides, you know, to
every bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he isn&rsquo;t anything to me,&rdquo;
said Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s not quite seventeen years
old yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor boy!&nbsp; What a shame to dispose of him so
soon.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll let him off for a year or two;
won&rsquo;t we, Miss Coverdale?&nbsp; But as there seems by
acknowledgment to be one beau with unappropriated
services&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I have appropriated nobody,&rdquo; said
Patty, &ldquo;and didn&rsquo;t intend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Godfrey, then, is the only knight whose services are
claimed,&rdquo; said Miss Holmes, looking at Bessy.&nbsp; Bessy
made no immediate answer with either her eyes or tongue; but when
the Coverdales were gone, she took her new friend to task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you fill those young girls&rsquo; heads with
such nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nature has done that, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But nature should be trained; should it not?&nbsp; You
will make them think that those foolish boys are in love with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The foolish boys, as you call them, will look after
that themselves.&nbsp; It seems to me that the foolish boys know
what they are about better than some of their
elders.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, she
added, &ldquo;As for my brother, I have no patience with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray do not discuss your brother,&rdquo; said
Bessy.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, Bella, unless you wish to drive me away,
pray do not speak of him and me together as you did just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you so bad as that,&mdash;that the slightest
commonplace joke upsets you?&nbsp; Would not his services be due
to you as a matter of course?&nbsp; If you are so sore about it,
you will betray your own secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no secret,&mdash;none at least from you, or from
mamma; and, indeed, none from him.&nbsp; We were both very
foolish, thinking that we knew each other and our own hearts,
when we knew neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to hear people talk of knowing their
hearts.&nbsp; My idea is, that if you like a young man, and he
asks you to marry him, you ought to have him.&nbsp; That is, if
there is enough to live on.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what more is
wanted.&nbsp; But girls are getting to talk and think as though
they were to send their hearts through some fiery furnace of
trial before they may give them up to a husband&rsquo;s
keeping.&nbsp; I am not at all sure that the French fashion is
not the best, and that these things shouldn&rsquo;t be managed by
the fathers and mothers, or perhaps by the family lawyers.&nbsp;
Girls who are so intent upon knowing their own hearts generally
end by knowing nobody&rsquo;s heart but their own; and then they
die old maids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better that than give themselves to the keeping of
those they don&rsquo;t know and cannot esteem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a matter of taste.&nbsp; I mean to take
the first that comes, so long as he looks like a gentleman, and
has not less than eight hundred a year.&nbsp; Now Godfrey does
look like a gentleman, and has double that.&nbsp; If I had such a
chance I shouldn&rsquo;t think twice about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have no such chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way the wind blows; is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; Oh, Bella, pray, pray leave me
alone.&nbsp; Pray do not interfere.&nbsp; There is no wind
blowing in any way.&nbsp; All that I want is your silence and
your sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; I will be silent and sympathetic as
the grave.&nbsp; Only don&rsquo;t imagine that I am cold as the
grave also.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t exactly appreciate your ideas;
but if I can do no good, I will at any rate endeavour to do no
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After lunch, at about three, they started on their walk, and
managed to ferry themselves over the river.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, do
let me, Bessy,&rdquo; said Kate Coverdale.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
understand all about it.&nbsp; Look here, Miss Holmes.&nbsp; You
pull the chain through your hands&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And inevitably tear your gloves to pieces,&rdquo; said
Miss Holmes.&nbsp; Kate certainly had done so, and did not seem
to be particularly well pleased with the accident.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a nasty nail in the chain,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder those stupid boys did not tell
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course they reached the trysting-place much too soon, and
were very tired of walking up and down to keep their feet warm,
before the sportsmen came up.&nbsp; But this was their own fault,
seeing that they had reached the stile half an hour before the
time fixed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never will go anywhere to meet gentlemen
again,&rdquo; said Miss Holmes.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is most
preposterous that ladies should be left in the snow for an
hour.&nbsp; Well, young men, what sport have you had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shot the big black cock,&rdquo; said Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you indeed?&rdquo; said Kate Coverdale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here are the feathers out of his tail for
you.&nbsp; He dropped them in the water, and I had to go in after
them up to my middle.&nbsp; But I told you that I would, so I was
determined to get them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you silly, silly boy,&rdquo; said Kate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll keep them for ever.&nbsp; I will
indeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was said a little apart, for Harry had
managed to draw the young lady aside before he presented the
feathers.</p>
<p>Frank had also his trophies for Patty, and the tale to tell of
his own prowess.&nbsp; In that he was a year older than his
brother, he was by a year&rsquo;s growth less ready to tender his
present to his lady-love, openly in the presence of them
all.&nbsp; But he found his opportunity, and then he and Patty
went on a little in advance.&nbsp; Kate also was deep in her
consolations to Harry for his ducking; and therefore the four
disposed of themselves in the manner previously suggested by Miss
Holmes.&nbsp; Miss Holmes, therefore, and her brother, and Bessy
Garrow, were left together in the path, and discussed the
performances of the day in a manner that elicited no very
ecstatic interest.&nbsp; So they walked for a mile, and by
degrees the conversation between them dwindled down almost to
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing I dislike so much as coming out with
people younger than myself,&rdquo; said Miss Holmes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One always feels so old and dull.&nbsp; Listen to those
children there; they make me feel as though I were an old maiden
aunt, brought out with them to do propriety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patty won&rsquo;t at all approve if she hears you call
her a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor shall I approve, if she treats me like an old
woman,&rdquo; and then she stepped on and joined the
children.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t spoil even their sport if
I could help it,&rdquo; she said to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
with them I shall only be a temporary nuisance; if I remain
behind I shall become a permanent evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus
Bessy and her old lover were left by themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will get on well with Bella,&rdquo; said
Godfrey, when they had remained silent for a minute or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp; She is so good-natured and
light-spirited that everybody must like her.&nbsp; She has been
used to so much amusement and active life, that I know she must
find it very dull here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is never dull anywhere,&mdash;even at Liverpool,
which, for a young lady, I sometimes think the dullest place on
earth.&nbsp; I know it is for a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man who has work to do can never be dull; can
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed he can; as dull as death.&nbsp; I am so often
enough.&nbsp; I have never been very bright there, Bessy, since
you left us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing in his calling her Bessy, for it had become
a habit with him since they were children; and they had formerly
agreed that everything between them should be as it had been
before that foolish whisper of love had been spoken and
received.&nbsp; Indeed, provision had been made by them specially
on this point, so that there need be no awkwardness in this mode
of addressing each other.&nbsp; Such provision had seemed to be
very prudent, but it hardly had the desired effect on the present
occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know what you mean by brightness,&rdquo; she
said, after a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps it is not intended that
people&rsquo;s lives should be what you call bright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life ought to be as bright as we can make
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all depends on the meaning of the word.&nbsp; I
suppose we are not very bright here at Thwaite Hall, but yet we
think ourselves very happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you are,&rdquo; said Godfrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
very often think of you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always think of places where we have been when we
were young,&rdquo; said Bessy; and then again they walked on for
some way in silence, and Bessy began to increase her pace with
the view of catching the children.&nbsp; The present walk to her
was anything but bright, and she bethought herself with dismay
that there were still two miles before she reached the Ferry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bessy,&rdquo; Godfrey said at last.&nbsp; And then he
stopped as though he were doubtful how to proceed.&nbsp; She,
however, did not say a word, but walked on quickly, as though her
only hope was in catching the party before her.&nbsp; But they
also were walking quickly, for Bella was determined that she
would not be caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bessy, I must speak to you once of what passed between
us at Liverpool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you positively forbid it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Godfrey,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; And they did stop
in the path, for now she no longer thought of putting an end to
her embarrassment by overtaking her companions.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
any such words are necessary for your comfort, it would hardly
become me to forbid them.&nbsp; Were I to speak so harshly you
would accuse me afterwards in your own heart.&nbsp; It must be
for you to judge whether it is well to reopen a wound that is
nearly healed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But with me it is not nearly healed.&nbsp; The wound is
open always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some hurts,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;which do
not admit of an absolute and perfect cure, unless after long
years.&rdquo;&nbsp; As she said so, she could not but think how
much better was his chance of such perfect cure than her
own.&nbsp; With her,&mdash;so she said to herself,&mdash;such
curing was all but impossible; whereas with him, it was as
impossible that the injury should last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bessy,&rdquo; he said, and he again stopped her on the
narrow path, standing immediately before her on the way,
&ldquo;you remember all the circumstances that made us
part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I think I remember them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you still think that we were right to
part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused for a moment before she answered him; but it was
only for a moment, and then she spoke quite firmly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, Godfrey, I do; I have thought about it much since
then.&nbsp; I have thought, I fear, to no good purpose about
aught else.&nbsp; But I have never thought that we had been
unwise in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I think you loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am bound to confess I did so, as otherwise I must
confess myself a liar.&nbsp; I told you at the time that I loved
you, and I told you so truly.&nbsp; But it is better, ten times
better, that those who love should part, even though they still
should love, than that two should be joined together who are
incapable of making each other happy.&nbsp; Remember what you
told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found yourself unhappy in your engagement, and you
said it was my fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bessy, there is my hand.&nbsp; If you have ceased to
love me, there is an end of it.&nbsp; But if you love me still,
let all that be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgotten, Godfrey!&nbsp; How can it be
forgotten?&nbsp; You were unhappy, and it was my fault.&nbsp; My
fault, as it would be if I tried to solace a sick child with
arithmetic, or feed a dog with grass.&nbsp; I had no right to
love you, knowing you as I did; and knowing also that my ways
would not be your ways.&nbsp; My punishment I understand, and it
is not more than I can bear; but I had hoped that your punishment
would have been soon over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too proud, Bessy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very likely.&nbsp; Frank says that I am a
Puritan, and pride was the worst of their sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too proud and unbending.&nbsp; In marriage should not
the man and woman adapt themselves to each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they are married, yes.&nbsp; And every girl who
thinks of marrying should know that in very much she must adapt
herself to her husband.&nbsp; But I do not think that a woman
should be the ivy, to take the direction of every branch of the
tree to which she clings.&nbsp; If she does so, what can be her
own character?&nbsp; But we must go on, or we shall be too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will give me no other answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None other, Godfrey.&nbsp; Have you not just now, at
this very moment, told me that I was too proud?&nbsp; Can it be
possible that you should wish to tie yourself for life to female
pride?&nbsp; And if you tell me that now, at such a moment as
this, what would you tell me in the close intimacy of married
life, when the trifles of every day would have worn away the
courtesies of guest and lover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sharpness of rebuke in this which Godfrey Holmes
could not at the moment overcome.&nbsp; Nevertheless he knew the
girl, and understood the workings of her heart and mind.&nbsp;
Now, in her present state, she could be unbending, proud, and
almost rough.&nbsp; In that she had much to lose in declining the
renewed offer which he made her, she would, as it were,
continually prompt herself to be harsh and inflexible.&nbsp; Had
he been poor, had she not loved him, had not all good things
seemed to have attended the promise of such a marriage, she would
have been less suspicious of herself in receiving the offer, and
more gracious in replying to it.&nbsp; Had he lost all his money
before he came back to her, she would have taken him at once; or
had he been deprived of an eye, or become crippled in his legs,
she would have done so.&nbsp; But, circumstanced as he was, she
had no motive to tenderness.&nbsp; There was an organic defect in
her character, which no doubt was plainly marked by its own bump
in her cranium,&mdash;the bump of philomartyrdom, it might
properly be called.&nbsp; She had shipwrecked her own happiness
in rejecting Godfrey Holmes; but it seemed to her to be the
proper thing that a well-behaved young lady should shipwreck her
own happiness.&nbsp; For the last month or two she had been
tossed about by the waters and was nearly drowned.&nbsp; Now
there was beautiful land again close to her, and a strong
pleasant hand stretched out to save her.&nbsp; But though she had
suffered terribly among the waves, she still thought it wrong to
be saved.&nbsp; It would be so pleasant to take that hand, so
sweet, so joyous, that it surely must be wrong.&nbsp; That was
her doctrine; and Godfrey Holmes, though he hardly analysed the
matter, partly understood that it was so.&nbsp; And yet, if once
she were landed on that green island, she would be so
happy.&nbsp; She spoke with scorn of a woman clinging to a tree
like ivy; and yet, were she once married, no woman would cling to
her husband with sweeter feminine tenacity than Bessy
Garrow.&nbsp; He spoke no further word to her as he walked home,
but in handing her down to the ferry-boat he pressed her
hand.&nbsp; For a second it seemed as though she had returned
this pressure.&nbsp; If so, the action was involuntary, and her
hand instantly resumed its stiffness to his touch.</p>
<p>It was late that night when Major Garrow went to his bedroom,
but his wife was still up, waiting for him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what has he said to
you?&nbsp; He has been with you above an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such stories are not very quickly told; and in this
case it was necessary to understand him very accurately.&nbsp; At
length I think I do understand him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not necessary to repeat at length all that was said on
that night between Major and Mrs. Garrow, as to the offer which
had now for a third time been made to their daughter.&nbsp; On
that evening, after the ladies had gone, and when the two boys
had taken themselves off, Godfrey Holmes told his tale to his
host, and had honestly explained to him what he believed to be
the state of his daughter&rsquo;s feelings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now you
know all,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do believe that she
loves me, and if she does, perhaps she may still listen to
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Major Garrow did not feel sure that he
&ldquo;knew it all.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when he had fully discussed
the matter that night with his wife, then he thought that perhaps
he had arrived at that knowledge.</p>
<p>On the following morning Bessy learned from the maid, at an
early hour, that Godfrey Holmes had left Thwaite Hall and gone
back to Liverpool.&nbsp; To the girl she said nothing on the
subject, but she felt obliged to say a word or two to
Bella.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is his coming that I regret,&rdquo; she
said;&mdash;&ldquo;that he should have had the trouble and
annoyance for nothing.&nbsp; I acknowledge that it was my fault,
and I am very sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cannot be helped,&rdquo; said Miss Holmes, somewhat
gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to his misfortunes, I presume that his
journeys between here and Liverpool are not the worst of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After breakfast on that day Bessy was summoned into her
father&rsquo;s book-room, and found him there, and her mother
also.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bessy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sit down, my
dear.&nbsp; You know why Godfrey has left us this
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessy walked round the room, so that in sitting she might be
close to her mother and take her mother&rsquo;s hand in her
own.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose I do, papa,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was with me late last night, Bessy; and when he told
me what had passed between you I agreed with him that he had
better go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was better that he should go, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has left a message for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A message, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bessy.&nbsp; And your mother agrees with me that
it had better be given to you.&nbsp; It is this,&mdash;that if
you will send him word to come again, he will be here by
Twelfth-night.&nbsp; He came before on my invitation, but if he
returns it must be on yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa, I cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not say that you can, but think of it calmly
before you altogether refuse.&nbsp; You shall give me your answer
on New Year&rsquo;s morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma knows that it would be impossible,&rdquo; said
Bessy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not impossible, dearest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In such a matter you should do what you believe to be
right,&rdquo; said her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were to ask him here again, it would be telling
him that I would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Bessy.&nbsp; It would be telling him that you
would be his wife.&nbsp; He would understand it so, and so would
your mother and I.&nbsp; It must be so understood
altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, papa, when we were at Liverpool&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told him everything, dearest,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Garrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand the whole,&rdquo; said the Major;
&ldquo;and in such a matter as this I will not give you counsel
on either side.&nbsp; But you must remember that in making up
your mind, you must think of him as well as of yourself.&nbsp; If
you do not love him;&mdash;if you feel that as his wife you
should not love him, there is not another word to be said.&nbsp;
I need not explain to my daughter that under such circumstances
she would be wrong to encourage the visits of a suitor.&nbsp; But
your mother says you do love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not ask you.&nbsp; But if you do;&mdash;if you
have so told him, and allowed him to build up an idea of his
life-happiness on such telling, you will, I think, sin greatly
against him by allowing a false feminine pride to mar his
happiness.&nbsp; When once a girl has confessed to a man that she
loves him, the confession and the love together put upon her the
burden of a duty towards him, which she cannot with impunity
throw aside.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he kissed her, and bidding her
give him a reply on the morning of the new year, left her with
her mother.</p>
<p>She had four days for consideration, and they went past her by
no means easily.&nbsp; Could she have been alone with her mother,
the struggle would not have been so painful; but there was the
necessity that she should talk to Isabella Holmes, and the
necessity also that she should not neglect the Coverdales.&nbsp;
Nothing could have been kinder than Bella.&nbsp; She did not
speak on the subject till the morning of the last day, and then
only in a very few words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bessy,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;as you are great, be merciful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not great, and it would not be
mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; said Bella, &ldquo;he has surely a
right to his own opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that evening she was sitting alone in her room when her
mother came to her, and her eyes were red with weeping.&nbsp; Pen
and paper were before her, as though she were resolved to write,
but hitherto no word had been written.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Bessy,&rdquo; said her mother, sitting down close
beside her; &ldquo;is the deed done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What deed, mamma?&nbsp; Who says that I am to do
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deed is not the writing, but the resolution to
write.&nbsp; Five words will be sufficient,&mdash;if only those
five words may be written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for one&rsquo;s whole life, mamma.&nbsp; For his
life, as well as my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Bessy;&mdash;that is quite true.&nbsp; But
equally true whether you bid him come or allow him to remain
away.&nbsp; That task of making up one&rsquo;s mind for life,
must at last be done in some special moment of that
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, mamma; tell me what I should do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this Mrs. Garrow would not do.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will write
the words for you if you like,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it is
you who must resolve that they shall be written.&nbsp; I cannot
bid my darling go away and leave me for another home;&mdash;I can
only say that in my heart I do believe that home would be a happy
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was morning before the note was written, but when the
morning came Bessy had written it and brought it to her
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take it to papa,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Then
she went and hid herself from all eyes till the noon had
passed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear Godfrey,&rdquo; the letter ran,
&ldquo;Papa says that you will return on Wednesday if I write to
ask you.&nbsp; Do come back to us,&mdash;if you wish it.&nbsp;
Yours always, Bessy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as good as though she had filled the
sheet,&rdquo; said the Major.&nbsp; But in sending it to Godfrey
Holmes, he did not omit a few accompanying remarks of his
own.</p>
<p>An answer came from Godfrey by return of post; and on the
afternoon of the sixth of January, Frank Garrow drove over to the
station at Penrith to meet him.&nbsp; On their way back to
Thwaite Hall there grew up a very close confidence between the
two future brothers-in-law, and Frank explained with great
perspicuity a little plan which he had arranged himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As soon as it is dark, so that she won&rsquo;t see it,
Harry will hang it up in the dining-room,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and mind you go in there before you go anywhere
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad you have come back, Godfrey,&rdquo; said
the Major, meeting him in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, dear Godfrey,&rdquo; said Mrs. Garrow,
&ldquo;you will find Bessy in the dining-room,&rdquo; she
whispered; but in so whispering she was quite unconscious of the
mistletoe bough.</p>
<p>And so also was Bessy, nor do I think that she was much more
conscious when that introduction was over.&nbsp; Godfrey had made
all manner of promises to Frank, but when the moment arrived, he
had found the moment too important for any special reference to
the little bough above his head.&nbsp; Not so, however, Patty
Coverdale.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame,&rdquo; said she,
bursting out of the room, &ldquo;and if I&rsquo;d known what you
had done, nothing on earth should have induced me to go in.&nbsp;
I won&rsquo;t enter the room till I know that you have taken it
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless her sister Kate was bold enough to
solve the mystery before the evening was over.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
